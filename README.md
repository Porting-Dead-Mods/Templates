## <u>_Templates, by Porting Dead Mods_</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Templates are drop-in quick starts, utility files, or just code examples that couldn't be included into Porting Dead Libs due to the fact the code itself needs to be modified on a per project basis. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently we are adding as many files as we can from projects that we have already worked on, but if you have any code examples, utilities, or a piece of code that you think would be useful to others, please feel free to submit a PR to the corresponding version branch and we will gladly accept it!
<br>
### <u>_Contributing_</u>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever you make a PR, please also edit the ```CREDITS.txt``` on the branch you are submitting to with your name and files added <3
